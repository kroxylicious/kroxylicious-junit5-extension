# status: The level of internal Log4j events that should be logged to the console.
# Valid values for this attribute are "off", "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "fatal", and "all".
# Log4j will log details about initialization, rollover and other internal actions to the status logger.
# Setting status="trace" is one of the first tools available to you if you need to troubleshoot log4j.
# (Alternatively, setting system property log4j2.debug will also print internal Log4j2 logging to the console,
# including internal logging that took place before the configuration file was found.)
